[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, one needs a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

**Reflection on my learnings üöÄ
 - Learnt the working of Flex box and box model.
 - Understood how to avoid shaking of a button when hovered upon
 - Refined my knowledge of DOM manipulation in things like toggling between display properties to show dropdowns
 - Understood the BEM conventions in CSS.
 - Used SASS preprocessor.
 
 **More fine-tuning needed to the project/ Future modifications ‚è±Ô∏è
  - Make it responsive for mobile screens
  - Add more functionality
